🛳️ Titanic Dataset Analysis
This project performs data analysis and preprocessing on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns in passenger survival. It involves cleaning the dataset, exploring key features, and preparing the data for future machine learning applications.

📂 Project Structure:

├── Titanic-Dataset.csv           # Raw dataset
├── cleaned_titanic_dataset.csv   # Cleaned version of the dataset
├── Untitled6.ipynb               # Jupyter notebook with analysis and preprocessing
└── README.md                     # Project documentation

📌 Objectives:

Load and explore the Titanic dataset.

Handle missing values and outliers.

Perform feature engineering and encoding.

Save the cleaned dataset for model training or visualization.

🔧 Requirements:

Make sure the following Python packages are installed:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

🚀 How to Run:

Clone this repository or download the files.

Open the Jupyter notebook Untitled6.ipynb.

Run each cell step by step to:

Load the raw dataset.

Clean and preprocess the data.

Visualize distributions and correlations.

Save the cleaned dataset.

📊 Key Features Processed:

Handling Missing Values: Filled or dropped missing values in columns like Age, Cabin, and Embarked.

Feature Engineering: Created new features (e.g., Family size), processed categorical variables.

Data Visualization: Used matplotlib and seaborn for insights into survival by class, gender, age, etc.

📁 Output:

A cleaned dataset saved as cleaned_titanic_dataset.csv, ready for ML modeling or further analysis.

📈 Future Work:

Implement machine learning models to predict survival.

Use pipelines for automated preprocessing.

Explore advanced visualization techniques.
